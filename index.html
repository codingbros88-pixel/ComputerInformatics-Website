<section id="Basic Technical Information">
<h2>💻Basic Technical Information</h2></section>
<p>The technical sector of computing covers the core hardware, software, and infrastructure that enable digital systems to function. It includes processor and memory design, storage and peripheral management, operating systems, networking, and backend services, with a focus on performance, reliability, scalability, and security. Professionals in this area work on system architecture, diagnostics, optimization, and integration to ensure efficient and resilient IT solutions.</p>

<section id="hardware">
<h2>🔧Core hardware:</h2></section>
<p>The core hardware of a computer includes the central processing unit (CPU), system memory (RAM), persistent storage (HDD/SSD/NVMe), motherboard, power supply unit (PSU), and cooling solutions. Graphics processing units (GPUs), network and storage controllers, and specialized accelerators handle dedicated workloads, while buses and interfaces (PCIe, SATA, USB) connect components and peripherals. Together these elements define system performance, power efficiency, reliability, and upgrade paths; selecting and configuring them correctly ensures the machine meets its intended tasks.</p>

<section id="software">
<h2>⚙️Software:</h2></section>
<p>Software includes system software—such as operating systems, drivers, and virtualization layers—that manage hardware resources; middleware and runtimes that enable services and integrations; and application software that delivers end-user functionality. It also encompasses development tools, libraries, APIs, and deployment pipelines used to build, test, and operate systems. Well-designed software emphasizes modularity, security, performance, maintainability, and observability, and relies on practices like automated testing, CI/CD, and containerization to achieve reliable, scalable deployments.</p>

<section id="infrastructure">
<h2>🏗️Infrastructure:</h2></section>
<p>Infrastructure refers to the underlying platforms and services that deliver and operate applications at scale, including networks, data centers, cloud providers, virtualization, storage arrays, and content delivery networks (CDNs). It covers load balancing, routing, DNS, security controls, monitoring and logging, backups, and disaster recovery — all orchestrated to ensure availability, performance, and resilience. Modern infrastructure uses automation and Infrastructure as Code (IaC), container orchestration, and observability practices to enable rapid, repeatable deployments and efficient scaling.</p>

<section id="networking">
<h2>🌐networking</h2></section>
<p>Computer networking enables devices to communicate and share resources across local and global connections. It relies on protocols like TCP/IP to transmit data between devices, using hardware such as routers, switches, and network interface cards. Networks can be configured as local area networks (LANs) for home or office use, or wide area networks (WANs) that span larger geographical areas like the internet. Basic network security measures include firewalls, encryption, and authentication to protect data during transmission.</p>

<section id="cpu">
<h2>⚡The CPU, (otherwise known as the Central Processing Unit)</h2></section>
<p>The CPU is the central processor of a computer that runs programs by fetching, decoding, and executing instructions. It performs calculations, controls data flow between memory and devices, and schedules tasks; modern CPUs use multiple cores and caches to improve performance.</p>

<section id="ram">
<h2>🧠The RAM, (otherwise known as Random Access Memory)</h2></section>
<p>RAM is the computer's volatile system memory used to store data and instructions the CPU needs immediately. It's much faster than long‑term storage, so having more RAM and faster memory improves multitasking and application responsiveness. Common modern types include DDR4 and DDR5 DIMMs.</p>

<section id="storage">
<h2>💾The Storage Units</h2></section>
<p>Storage units hold data persistently when power is off. Hard disk drives (HDDs) use spinning platters and offer large capacity at lower cost but with slower access times. Solid state drives (SSDs) use NAND flash for much faster reads/writes and greater durability. NVMe SSDs connect via the PCIe bus for the highest throughput and lowest latency. Other storage options include external drives, NAS (network-attached storage), and cloud storage, each trading off cost, capacity, performance, and accessibility.</p>

<section id="psu">
<h2>🔌The PSU (otherwise known as the Power SUpply)</h2></section>
<p>The power supply unit (PSU) converts AC mains electricity into the DC voltages required by the motherboard, CPU, GPU, drives, and peripherals. Choose a PSU with sufficient wattage headroom for current and future components, and prefer higher efficiency ratings (80 Plus Bronze/Gold/Platinum) to reduce heat and energy waste. Modular designs simplify cable management, while high-quality units provide stable voltage rails, appropriate connectors (24-pin ATX, EPS for CPU, PCIe for GPUs, SATA/Molex), and safeguards such as over-voltage, under-voltage, over-current, and short-circuit protection. Good cooling and a reputable manufacturer improve reliability and lifespan.</p>

<section id="motherboard">
<h2>🖥️The motherboard</h2></section>
<p>The motherboard is the main printed circuit board that connects and coordinates all core components: the CPU socket, RAM (DIMM) slots, PCIe expansion slots for GPUs and cards, storage interfaces (SATA and M.2), and power/connectivity headers. It contains the chipset and VRMs (voltage regulator modules) that manage power delivery and I/O routing, and firmware (BIOS/UEFI) for hardware initialization and configuration. Choose a board by considering form factor (ATX/mATX/ITX), chipset features (PCIe lanes, SATA/M.2 support), VRM quality for stable power and overclocking, onboard connectivity (Ethernet, Wi‑Fi, USB), and available expansion slots and ports to match your build and upgrade plans.</p>

<section id="gpu">
<h2>🎮The GPU (otherwise known as the Graphical Processing Unit)</h2></section>
<P>The GPU accelerates graphics rendering and parallel computation by processing many threads at once. It contains hundreds to thousands of cores optimized for vector and matrix math, and dedicated video memory (VRAM) to store textures, framebuffers, and large datasets. GPUs can be integrated (on‑chip) or discrete cards connected via PCIe; discrete GPUs usually offer far higher performance for gaming, 3D rendering, and compute tasks like machine learning and video encoding. Important characteristics include core count, clock speed, VRAM size and bandwidth, driver support, and power/cooling requirements. Software accesses GPU features through APIs such as Direct3D, OpenGL, Vulkan, CUDA, and OpenCL.</P>

<section id="buses">
<h2>💿Buses and Interfaces</h2></section>
<p>Buses and interfaces connect a computer's internal components and external devices. USB is used for general-purpose external peripherals, SATA connects traditional storage drives, and PCIe provides high-speed lanes for GPUs, NVMe storage, and expansion cards. Each interface differs in bandwidth, latency, and typical use cases.</p>
